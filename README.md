This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) app. To install the required dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

Then, to start the local preview server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your app.

## Project structure

A typical Framework project looks like this:

```ini
.
├─ src
│  ├─ generateLoanData.js      # loan projection code
│  ├─ plotIntAndPrincipal.js   # plotting code
│  ├─ index.md                 # the home page
│  ├─ plotOSLoan.js            # plotting code
│  ├─ styles.css               # custom syles
│  └─ utils.js                 # helper functions
├─ .gitignore
├─ observablehq.config.js      # the app config file
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

**`src`** - This is the “source root” — where all the code lives. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/project-structure#routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`src/index.md`** - This is the home page for your app. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`observablehq.config.js`** - This is the [app configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the app’s title.
